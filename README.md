# 🛡️ Uniswap V2 — Scroll One

This is my personal exploration of Uniswap V2 —  
an attempt to understand each contract line by line, not just for knowledge, but for discipline.

---

## 💡 Why start here?

Uniswap V2 is simple, elegant, and still foundational to DeFi.  
Studying it teaches more than just DEX mechanics — it teaches restraint, logic, and attention to small details.

I’m approaching this slowly, as a student of smart contract security.  
Not to critique, but to understand.

## 🔍 What this scroll contains

- Annotated breakdowns of core V2 contracts (`Pair`, `Factory`, `Router`)
- Custom test cases (sandboxed on a forked mainnet)
- Security-focused edge case experiments
- Quiet thoughts. No noise. Just code and logic.

## 📁 Folder Overview

- `UniswapV2Pair.md` — notes + reasoning per function
- `notes/` — deep dives into math, overflow, price behavior
- `sandbox-tests/`
  - `/audit/`: tests designed to stress or exploit

| `Pair`    | Burn, Mint, and Swap nearly complete |
| `Factory` | Next focus                           |
| `Router`  | Coming later                         |
