# 🛡️ Uniswap one version at a time

Welcome to **uniswap-audits** — my personal journey to understand and dissect every version of Uniswap, from **V2 through V4**. I'm not here to just read the docs. I'm here to become the doc. 📜✨

## 💡 Why?

I want to master smart contract security by starting with the most iconic DeFi protocol in existence. Uniswap is complex, battle-tested, and beautiful — which makes it the perfect training ground for an aspiring auditor like me.

## 🔍 What's inside?

- 📘 Fully annotated breakdowns of every major Uniswap contract
- 🧠 Audit-style notes, edge case thinking, and spicy observations
- 🧪 Optional test cases for hands-on exploration
- 🧰 Terminology cheat sheets and my own audit templates
- 🧬 Vibes. So many vibes.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Check the root folders for:

- `V2/`, `V3/`, and `V4/`: One subfolder per version
- `Templates/`: My custom audit format + terminology notes
- `Tests/`: Where I break things for fun

## 🚀 Status

- ✅ `UniswapV2Pair.md` in progress
- 🔜 `UniswapV2Factory.md`
- 🔮 `UniswapV3Pool.md` (soon)
- 🧙‍♀️ `Hooks/`
